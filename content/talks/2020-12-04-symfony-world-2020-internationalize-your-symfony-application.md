Translating an application is a big step while you develop an international project. Translation process of an application can be very tough. It can remain laborious even after the first release. So, we have a new type of workmate: dear developers, product owners, designers, let me introduce translators with whom we will have to work efficiently! Together, we will have to make sure that the translations stay up to date on production. How? This is exactly what we will be talking about in this conference. Tools like php-translation bundle, Loco or Transifex will be very useful to your team. We will plug them in Symfony to create an efficient workflow. We will also define responsibilities for developers, translators and designers. Everything to ease the translation process from development environment to production without any pain! At the end of this talk, you will be looking forward to implementing these amazing solutions!
