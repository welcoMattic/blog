## Sleepr

[Sleepr](https://sleepr.app/) brings back to life the missing sleep timer feature of macOS, removed from Ventura.

It provides a quick access to set a timer at the end of which your Mac goes into sleep mode.

When the timer is near the end, a native notification will suggest you to cancel the timer or extend it by 10 minutes. If no action is done by the end of the timer, the Mac will go to sleep.


## Tech

Built with 100% Swift and SwiftUI code, it leverage all brand new features released by Apple during WWDC23. Not one useless line of code, no tracking, only the essential to work.


## Future

Sleepr will evolve in future months to gain new features and ease users to retrieve an essential feature of macOS.
